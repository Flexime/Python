    "All objects share class or static variables. An instance or non-static variables are different for different objects (every object has a copy). For example, let a Computer Science Student be represented by class CSStudent. The class may have a static variable whose value is “cse” for all objects. And class may also have non-static members like name and roll. In C++ and Java, we can use static keywords to make a variable a class variable. The variables which don’t have a preceding static keyword are instance variables. See this for the Java example and this for the C++ example.\r\n",
