    "# Introduction to Pandas #\r\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. This library is built on top of the NumPy library. Pandas is fast and it has high performance & productivity for users."

    "## History ## \r\n",
    "Pandas were initially developed by Wes McKinney in 2008 while he was working at AQR Capital Management. He convinced the AQR to allow him to open source the Pandas. Another AQR employee, Chang She, joined as the second major contributor to the library in 2012. Over time many versions of pandas have been released. The latest version of the pandas is 1.0.1"

    "* Data from different file objects can be loaded. \r\n",
    "* Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data \r\n",
    "* Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects \r\n",
    "* Data set merging and joining. \r\n",
    "* Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets \r\n",
    "* Provides time-series functionality. \r\n",

It is built on the top of the NumPy library which means that a lot of structures of NumPy are used or replicated in Pandas. The data produced by Pandas are often used as input for plotting functions of Matplotlib, statistical analysis in SciPy, machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.\r\n",
